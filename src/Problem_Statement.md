go to the library.”</h1>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Located in a low-income area, Wisdom Public School has a student 
population of 400 and a faculty of 10 teachers.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">A well-wisher donated 200 books to the school library. 
However, the school library is still inadequate for the students as they do not have a librarian to handle the library.
Each teacher has one hour of free time each day.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">During this year,
the principal decided to build a dedicated library website where any teacher could access it using the provided credentials.
Those teachers who are available within an hour of the library’s opening time are requested to manage the library for 
the moment.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">Your help will be greatly 
appreciated by the principal in completing this website. You are assigned to create an array containing a list of teachers and their available hours.</p>

In order to do this, you will need to create two separate arrays containing a list of teachers and their available hours. 
In arrayMethodA, you can create a short-hand list of teachers and in arrayMethodB, you can construct teachers' available hours using array instatiation.
